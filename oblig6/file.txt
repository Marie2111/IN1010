Ole-Johan Dahl (October 12, 1931 / June 29, 2002) was a Norwegian computer scientist and is considered to be the father of Simula and object-oriented programming, together with Kristen Nygaard.
With Kristen Nygaard, he produced the initial ideas for object-oriented (OO) programming in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (NR - Norsk Regnesentral) as part of the Simula I (1961-1965) and Simula 67 (1965-1968) simulation programming languages
Dahl is a member of the small group of scientists who will be regarded as founders of their own field of science. His field was informatics and he won the two most prestigious international prizes specific to that field: The ACM A.M. Turing Award (considered to be the "Nobel Prize of Computing"), in 2001 and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal. He was made Commander of The Order of Saint Olav by the King of Norway in 2000, and received a number of other signs of recognition.
